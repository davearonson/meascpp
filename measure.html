This is a set of classes (and objects and sample programs) in C++, aimed at
preventing programming errors that result from mismatched units of measure.
The best-known recent example would be the Mars Lander crash, blamed on mixing
metric and so-called "English" units.  Using this library, that would have
thrown an exception, so the error would have been much easier to catch in
testing.  Files include:

- measure.hpp (declaration of Measure class)

- measure.cpp (implementation of Measure class)

- measuredefs.hpp (declaration of some built-in Measures)

- unit.hpp (declaration of Unit class)

- unit.cpp (implementation of Unit class)

- unitdefs.hpp (declaration of some built-in Units)

- Makefile (if you have use for this you know what it is)

- test.cpp (was some tests; now just dumps the units)

- cvtunits.cpp (sample program; converts between feet/meters and slugs/kilos)

- falldist.cpp (sample program; tells how far something falls in N seconds)

- falltime.cpp (sample program; tells how long it takes something to fall N meters)

- measure.txt (main documentation)

- api.txt (API documentation)
